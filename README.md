🧮 Knapsack Problem Visualization using Dynamic Programming Approach

This project is a Python GUI application built with Tkinter and Matplotlib, designed to visualize the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using the Dynamic Programming approach.
It helps learners and students understand how optimal items are selected to maximize the total value within a given capacity constraint.

📘 Overview

The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic Dynamic Programming (DP) problem where you are given:

A set of items, each with a weight and a value.

A knapsack (bag) with a capacity limit.

The goal is to determine which items to include in the knapsack so that:

The total value is maximized, and

The total weight does not exceed the capacity.

This application provides:

A simple Tkinter interface for user inputs.

A graphical visualization (bar chart) of selected and unselected items.

Real-time computation of maximum achievable value and selected item indices.

🎯 Objective

To help visualize and understand how Dynamic Programming solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem by:

Demonstrating the DP table computation process (conceptually).

Showing which items are chosen to achieve the maximum profit.

Presenting results interactively and visually.
